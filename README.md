## -- PROJECT DESCRIPTION - -

Human Activity Recognition with Postural Transition (HARPT) Using Smartphone Sensors

There has been an unprecedented escalation of research in the human activity and behaviour detection domain in recent years that has change our lifestyle. More and more AI specialized systems are being developed to support life in all sectors. This report demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning pipelines and frameworks such as SKLearn, Keras, TensorFlow on neural networks - MLP, CNN and ANN for the detection of Human Activity Recognition with Postural Transitions (HARPT) while reviewing other research works to understand the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Services in the project as well as the model deployment on the cloud to Amazon Web Services. Some problems encountered were the complexity surrounding the detection of HARPT due to subject and location sensitivity, and resource constraints.


## -- Basic goals:--

i.	To implement Deep Neural Network - MLP, CNN and ANN in the context of human activity recognition. 

ii.	To create and save machine learning model Pipeline (SKLearn, TensorFlow, etc.) as a ‘production ready’ function. 

iii.	To demonstrate appropriate use of applicable Cloud data analytics and programming frameworks to implement AI applications.
